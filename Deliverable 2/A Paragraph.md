This project is to make a database system for Crave on Campus, a food delivery service for students. Each person on campus can have an account, with differing details for student, faculty and staff accounts. Food orders will be placed at specific approved restaurants and will be delivered to specified locations on campus. Only students can be considered as drivers for the app. The app will keep track of individual orders and keep a ratings system for both drivers and restaurants.
